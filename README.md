# SpaceY
This is a data analysis project on SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to predict first-stage landing success. We collected data from the SpaceX API and Wikipedia, cleaned and merged it, and explored patterns through visualizations and SQL queries.
We built an interactive dashboard and trained several classification models to predict mission success based on payload, launch site, and booster version. Insights from this analysis can help optimize future launch decisions and reduce mission costs.

For a summary of the main findings and key conclusions, please refer to the presentation in **spaceX.pdf**.
